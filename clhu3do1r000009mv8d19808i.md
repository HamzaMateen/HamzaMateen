In the following snippet, ...

The '**print\_name**' function becomes the input of the '**decorate**' decorator. This is possible because Python considers its functions as **First Class Citizens.**  
In other words, functions can be **assigned to values** and **passed as arguments.**

```python
def decorate (the_function_to_be_decorated):
    def the_function_after_the_decoration (arguments):
        print("some decoration before calling the function")
        the_function_to_be_decorated(arguments)
        print("some decoration after calling the function")
    
    return the_function_after_the_decoration

@decorate
def print_name (name):
    print("Hi, ", name)

print_name("Hamza Mateen")
```

### Output

I hope you enjoyed it, and learned it in a **func** way!
